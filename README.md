## Usage
- The purpose of the Digital Notebook is to allow a user to add, modify and delete notes.
- The Digital Notebook must start the user on a landing page with a "get started" button
- The user will then be met with two columns on the next page.
- The left column is a history of notes that have been made and will populate the "note creator" when clicked on.
- The right column is a note creator that allows the user to enter a Note title and description.
- The note creator will have an add ans save button that will allow the user to add a new note and save it to the left hand column.
